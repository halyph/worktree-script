# Git Worktree Automation Script

An automated git worktree creation and management system that creates worktrees in a structured directory outside your main project.

## Features

- 🚀 **One-command worktree creation**: `wp feature-1` creates and switches to the worktree
- 📁 **Organized structure**: Worktrees stored in `{project}_worktrees/` directory
- 🌿 **Smart branch handling**: Works with existing local/remote branches or creates new ones
- ♻️ **Reuse existing worktrees**: Navigates to existing worktrees instead of failing
- 🛡️ **Comprehensive error handling**: Clear messages for all edge cases
- 🧹 **Easy cleanup**: Remove worktrees with `wpremove` command

## Installation

### Method 1: Add to .zshrc (Recommended)

1. Copy the contents of `git-worktree-automation.sh` to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Add this to the end of your ~/.zshrc file
cat git-worktree-automation.sh >> ~/.zshrc
```

2. Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Method 2: Source the script

1. Place the script in a permanent location:

```bash
cp git-worktree-automation.sh ~/.config/git-worktree-automation.sh
```

2. Add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.config/git-worktree-automation.sh
```

3. Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `wp <branch-name>` | Create/switch to worktree | `wp feature-1` |
| `wplist` | List all worktrees | `wplist` |
| `wpremove <branch>` | Remove a worktree | `wpremove feature-1` |

### Examples

#### Creating Worktrees

```bash
# In project "myproject"
wp feature-1           # Creates myproject_worktrees/feature-1
wp bugfix/issue-123    # Creates myproject_worktrees/bugfix/issue-123
wp hotfix-2024         # Creates myproject_worktrees/hotfix-2024
```

#### Managing Worktrees

```bash
# List all worktrees
wplist

# Output:
# 📋 Git worktrees for myproject:
#
# 📁 feature-1: /Users/you/projects/myproject_worktrees/feature-1
#    🌿 Branch: feature-1
#    📝 Commit: a1b2c3d4
#
# 📁 main: /Users/you/projects/myproject
#    🌿 Branch: main
#    📝 Commit: e5f6g7h8

# Remove a worktree
wpremove feature-1
```

## How It Works

### Directory Structure

When you run `wp feature-1` in a project called "myproject":

```
parent-directory/
├── myproject/                    # Original project
└── myproject_worktrees/          # Worktrees directory
    ├── feature-1/                # Your new worktree
    ├── bugfix-123/              # Another worktree
    └── hotfix-2024/             # Yet another worktree
```

### Branch Handling Logic

The script intelligently handles different branch scenarios:

1. **Existing Local Branch**: Creates worktree from local branch
2. **Existing Remote Branch**: Creates worktree tracking the remote branch
3. **New Branch**: Creates worktree with a new branch from current HEAD
4. **Existing Worktree**: Navigates to the existing worktree directory

### Safety Features

- ✅ Validates git repository before proceeding
- ✅ Checks for required parameters
- ✅ Handles worktree creation failures gracefully
- ✅ Prevents overwriting existing worktrees
- ✅ Provides clear error messages and suggestions
- ✅ Cleans up empty worktree directories after removal

## Script Components

### Main Functions

- **`wp()`**: Core worktree creation function
- **`wplist()`**: Lists all worktrees with details
- **`wpremove()`**: Safely removes worktrees

### Key Features Explained

#### Smart Path Resolution
```bash
# Gets the git repository root, not current subdirectory
local git_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
local current_dir=$(basename "$git_root")
```

#### Branch Detection
```bash
# Check local branches
git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$branch_name"

# Check remote branches
git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$branch_name"
```

#### Safe Worktree Creation
```bash
# For existing branches
git worktree add "$worktree_path" "$branch_name"

# For new branches
git worktree add -b "$branch_name" "$worktree_path"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error: "Not in a git repository"**
- Make sure you're running the command from within a git repository
- Run `git status` to verify you're in a git repo

**Error: "Failed to create worktree"**
- The branch might already be checked out in another worktree
- Use `wplist` to see existing worktrees
- Try `wpremove <branch>` if the worktree exists but is problematic

**Error: "Worktree not found"**
- Use `wplist` to see available worktrees
- Check if you're in the correct git repository

### Manual Cleanup

If something goes wrong, you can manually clean up:

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a problematic worktree
git worktree remove /path/to/worktree

# Or force remove if needed
git worktree remove --force /path/to/worktree
```

## Requirements

- Git 2.5+ (for `git worktree` support)
- Bash or Zsh shell
- Standard Unix utilities (basename, dirname, mkdir)
